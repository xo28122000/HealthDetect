<h1>HealthDetect</h1><br><br>

The aim of the project is to serve the medical purposes in third world countries
where medical infrastructure is not very strong.<br><br>

Our target audience are people of third world countries who:<br>
1 - are unable to visit a doctor due to either unavailability or financial issues.<br>
2 - search on the internet to find treatments to their common illnesses(like bumps or rashes)<br><br>

This app will help them determine what exatly is the problem they are faced with either by using a photo or by a series of questions,<br>
direct them to the required resources<br>
and send reports to a government body with the list of diseases detected and its metadata to improve the health care of that region accordingly.<br><br>

The front end of this app is a react app (in ./webapp/)<br>
The back end is a flask server which would serve the predictions of ML models (in ./backend/)<br>
