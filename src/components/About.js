      <p>
        Healthcare check-ups are expensive, invasive, and time-consuming. What
        if there was a way to automate these procedures? A computer could take
        the role of a doctor in determining whether or not you have certain
        diseases. We know that there are a lot of models already exist for
        detection some specific diseases. But how could to average person know
        how to deploy (much less train) a neural net according to a research
        paper? We introduce HealthDe.tech to solve this problem, an centralized
        app which gives users a multitude of options for diseases they want to
        check-up on. We curated some of the most common diseases that could be
        detected accurately using machine learning and computer vision. We then
        trained state-of-art TensorFlow models according to medical research
        papers. Finally, we deployed these models on Google's Cloud Platform and
        verified them against a model trained on Google's AutoML Vision API to
        deliver fast, accurate results to anyone who decides to use our service.

        We know that doctor/medical resources are limited and are expensive. So
        by using our app people can do a basic analysis with satisfactory
        precision and decrease the doctor visits thereby increasing the
        efficiency of doctors and saving a lot of money!
        <br /> All you need for our app to run a detection is an x-ray or blood
        sample diagram or in many cases just a photo!
